# Devo Challenge
Cities list with their pollution made in ReactJS.

## Requirements for technical test

Create a small web application that will consist of two pages. 
 - The first one will be a list with the TOP N cities polluted in Europe. With a filter and a sort list.
 - When the user clicks in one city they will be redirected to a different page that will show a map with a pointer located onto the city.

## Requirements for the project
+ Node version 10.18.1

## Documentation
You can find the React documentation [on the website](https://reactjs.org/docs).

Check out the [Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) page for a quick overview.


## How to install

```shell
$ npm install
```

## How to run
Just run the next command:
```shell
$ npm run start
```

It will show that everything is working:

Compiled successfully!

You can now view front_react in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000/
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.190.131:3000/

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.
```

When you launch `$ npm run start` and the web server starts whenever you change something in your code, the browser will be reload with the new changes.
